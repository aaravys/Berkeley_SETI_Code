**What is this script about?**

This script is about being able to interpret data signals from a signal that is 14.6 billion miles away. Isn't that wonderful? This script allows a user to interpret radio information from the voyager 1, although this code has many more practical uses.

**My future regarding this code**

As an aspiring scientist at Berkeley SETI, using radio telescopes and interpreting radio signals are absolutely necessary skills to have. This code is a vital stepping stone/foundation to my future as a scientist. It will help me navigate the mysteries of deep space that are hidden in radio signals.

**For people visiting**

This code will aid you. Not only is it fun to play around with and experiment, it is a great foundation if, like me, you want to be a part of SETI. It is a useful script, and I advise you to learn the ins and outs of it if you want to begin working with radios.
